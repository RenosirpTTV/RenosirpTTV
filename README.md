My name is Henry, but online I go by Renosirp.

I am a 20 yr old CompSci undergrad from the UK who plays way too many video games, music / music theory and I really enjoy progarmming.

Most of my old projects in the past weren't built for usability, mostly just technical / problem solving programs made in windows forms, but I am trying to push myself to learn more about as many languages as I can alongside my studies.

Any public projects I am working on, you can check out on my Git profile.
